## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Admin logs in** and creates courses.
2. **Admin creates student accounts** and assigns course access.
3. **Students log in** to access their enrolled courses.
4. **Students watch videos** or download materials during the active course period.
5. **Admin expires accounts** when the course ends, removing access.


## 🔒 Access Rules

* A student enrolled in **only Full Stack** → can view *only* Full Stack videos.
* A student enrolled in **Full Stack + Testing** → can view videos from *both* courses, but not others.
* Access is revoked automatically after the course completion date.

## 📌 Use Case Example

* **Institute** offers: Full Stack, Software Testing, Data Engineering.
* **Student A** enrolls in **Full Stack** → Access only Full Stack course.
* **Student B** enrolls in **Full Stack + Testing** → Access only these two courses.
* Once the course ends, **admin deletes the account** → No further access.
